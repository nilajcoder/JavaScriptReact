<!-- It includes the necessary DOCTYPE declaration, html, head, and body tags -->
<!-- The lang attribute in the html tag specifies the language of the document -->
<!-- The meta charset tag specifies the character encoding for the HTML document -->
<!-- The meta viewport tag is used for responsive web design, ensuring proper scaling on different devices -->
<!-- The title tag sets the title of the document, which appears in the browser tab -->
<!-- The body tag contains the content of the document, which is currently empty -->

  doctype html is a declaration that defines the document type and version of HTML being used.
    It is placed at the very beginning of an HTML document and helps browsers render the page correctly.
    The declaration is not an HTML tag but a declaration that informs the browser about the version of HTML being used.
    
   1. what is html?
    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages.
    It is used to structure content on the web and
     consists of a series of elements or tags that define the different parts of a webpage.
    HTML elements can include headings, paragraphs, links, images, lists, and more.

    hyper meaning "over" or "above," and text refers to the written content.
    The term "markup" refers to the way HTML uses tags to annotate text and define its structure.

2.what is web pages?
Web pages are documents that are displayed in a web browser
 and can contain text, images, videos, and other multimedia elements.
 3. what is meta ?
 "Meta" is short for "metadata," which means "data about data." 
 In web development, meta tags provide additional information about
  a webpage but are not visible to users. These tags are placed inside the <head> section of an HTML document.

    4. what is title?
    a title tag is an HTML element that defines the title of a webpage.
     The title is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab and is also used by 
     search engines as the clickable headline for search results.

5. what is head tag?
a head tag is an HTML element that contains meta-information about a webpage.
 It is placed within the <html> element and typically includes elements like <title>, <meta>, <link>, and <script> tags.
 The content inside the <head> tag is not displayed on the webpage itself but provides
     important information for browsers and search engines.
6. what is dom?
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents.
 It represents the structure of a webpage as a tree of objects,
  allowing developers to manipulate the content and structure of the page using JavaScript.
 The DOM provides methods and properties to access and modify elements, attributes, and styles in the HTML document.

 7.html is case sensitive or not?
HTML is not case-sensitive,
 meaning that HTML tags and attributes can be written in either uppercase or
  lowercase letters, or a combination of both. However, it is a 
  common practice to write HTML tags in lowercase for consistency and readability.
   For example, <html>, <head>, and <body> can be written as <HTML>, <HEAD>, and <BODY>, but it is recommended to use lowercase.

8.html is dom ?
The Document Object Model (DOM) is not HTML itself, but rather a representation of the HTML document in a structured format.
 The DOM is created by the web browser when it loads an HTML document
  and provides a way for programming languages like JavaScript to interact with and manipulate the content of the webpage.
 In summary, HTML is the markup language used to create web pages, 
 while the DOM is the object-oriented representation of that HTML document in memory.

 9. what is html element?
An HTML element consists of an opening tag, content (if applicable),
 and a closing tag. Elements define the structure and content of a webpage.


10.what is attribute?
An attribute is a special characteristic of an HTML element that provides additional information about that element.
 Attributes are always specified in the start tag and come in name/value pairs, such as name="value".
  For example, the <img> element can have attributes like src (source) and alt (alternative text)
   to specify the image file and its description.
  Attributes help define the behavior and appearance of HTML elements on a webpage.

11. what is tag?

A tag is a keyword or identifier used in HTML to define the start and end of an HTML element.
 Tags are enclosed in angle brackets, such as <tagname> for the opening tag and </tagname> for the closing tag.
  For example, the <h1> tag is used to define a top-level heading, while the </h1> tag marks the end of that heading.
  Tags can also have attributes that provide additional information about the element.

12. what is body tag?
The body tag is an HTML element that contains the main content of a webpage.
 It is placed within the <html> element and follows the <head> section.
  The content inside the <body> tag is what users see when they visit a webpage,
   including text, images, links, forms, and other multimedia elements.
   The <body> tag is essential for displaying the visible part of a web document.

13. what is semantic element?

A semantic element is an HTML element that conveys meaning about the content it contains,

    making it easier for both browsers and developers to understand the structure and purpose of the content.
    Semantic elements provide context and improve accessibility, search engine optimization (SEO), and maintainability of web pages.
    Examples of semantic elements include <header>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, <aside>, and <footer>. 
    These elements help define the roles of different parts of a webpage, enhancing its overall meaning and organization.

14. what is block vs inline element?

Block elements and inline elements are two types of HTML elements that differ in their display behavior:
    Starting with block elements:
    1. Block elements occupy the full width available and start on a new line.
    2. They create a "block" of content and can contain other block or inline elements.
    3. Examples include <div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, <ul>, <ol>, and <li>.
    Inline elements:
    1. Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.
    2. They can be placed within block elements without disrupting the flow of the document.
    3. Examples include <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, and <img>.


15. what is div tag?
The <div> tag is a block-level HTML element used to group and organize content on a webpage.    


16. what is span tag?
The <span> tag is an inline HTML element used to apply styles or group content 
    within a block-level element without creating a new line. It is often used for styling
     specific portions of text or other inline elements.


17. not closing tag in html?
The <br> tag is an example of a self-closing tag in HTML.

It is used to create a line break in the text without requiring a separate closing tag.
Example: <br> or <br />.
The <img> tag is another example of a self-closing tag in HTML. 
It is used to embed images in a webpage without requiring a separate closing tag.

2. Self-Closing Tags (No Need for Closing)
These tags do not require a closing tag:

<img>

<input>

<br>

<hr>

<meta>

<link>

<source>

<area>
