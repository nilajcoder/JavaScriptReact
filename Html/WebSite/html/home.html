<!-- This is a simple HTML document structure -->
<!-- It includes the necessary DOCTYPE declaration, html, head, and body tags -->
<!-- The lang attribute in the html tag specifies the language of the document -->
<!-- The meta charset tag specifies the character encoding for the HTML document -->
<!-- The meta viewport tag is used for responsive web design, ensuring proper scaling on different devices -->
<!-- The title tag sets the title of the document, which appears in the browser tab -->
<!-- The body tag contains the content of the document, which is currently empty -->
<!-- You can add your content inside the body tag as needed -->

   1. what is html?
    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages.
    It is used to structure content on the web and
     consists of a series of elements or tags that define the different parts of a webpage.
    HTML elements can include headings, paragraphs, links, images, lists, and more.
2.what is web pages?
Web pages are documents that are displayed in a web browser
 and can contain text, images, videos, and other multimedia elements.
 3. what is meta ?
 "Meta" is short for "metadata," which means "data about data." 
 In web development, meta tags provide additional information about
  a webpage but are not visible to users. These tags are placed inside the <head> section of an HTML document.

    4. what is title?
    a title tag is an HTML element that defines the title of a webpage.
     The title is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab and is also used by 
     search engines as the clickable headline for search results.

5. what is head tag?
a head tag is an HTML element that contains meta-information about a webpage.
 It is placed within the <html> element and typically includes elements like <title>, <meta>, <link>, and <script> tags.
 The content inside the <head> tag is not displayed on the webpage itself but provides
     important information for browsers and search engines.
6. what is dom?
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents.
 It represents the structure of a webpage as a tree of objects,
  allowing developers to manipulate the content and structure of the page using JavaScript.
 The DOM provides methods and properties to access and modify elements, attributes, and styles in the HTML document.

 7.html is case sensitive or not?
HTML is not case-sensitive,
 meaning that HTML tags and attributes can be written in either uppercase or
  lowercase letters, or a combination of both. However, it is a 
  common practice to write HTML tags in lowercase for consistency and readability.
   For example, <html>, <head>, and <body> can be written as <HTML>, <HEAD>, and <BODY>, but it is recommended to use lowercase.

8.html is dom ?
The Document Object Model (DOM) is not HTML itself, but rather a representation of the HTML document in a structured format.
 The DOM is created by the web browser when it loads an HTML document
  and provides a way for programming languages like JavaScript to interact with and manipulate the content of the webpage.
 In summary, HTML is the markup language used to create web pages, 
 while the DOM is the object-oriented representation of that HTML document in memory.

 9. what is html element?
An HTML element is a fundamental building block of an HTML document.
 It consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag.
  HTML elements can represent various types of content, such as text, images, links, forms, and more.
  For example, the <p> element represents a paragraph of text, while the <img> element represents an image.
  Each HTML element can also have attributes that provide additional information about the element.

10.what is attribute?
An attribute is a special characteristic of an HTML element that provides additional information about that element.
 Attributes are always specified in the start tag and come in name/value pairs, such as name="value".
  For example, the <img> element can have attributes like src (source) and alt (alternative text)
   to specify the image file and its description.
  Attributes help define the behavior and appearance of HTML elements on a webpage.


  11. what is navbar?
Navbar, short for navigation bar, is a user interface element that provides links to different sections or pages of a website.
 example of a navbar is a horizontal or vertical list of links that allows users to navigate through the website easily.
 tags of navbar are <nav> and <ul> and <li> and <a> tags.
    The <nav> tag is used to define the navigation section, while the <ul> tag creates an unordered list of links.
     Each link is represented by an <li> (list item) tag, and the actual link is created using the <a> (anchor) tag.

12. what block element?
A block element is an HTML element that occupies the full width available and starts on a new line.
 Block elements create a "block" of content and can contain other block or inline elements.
 Examples of block elements include <div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, <ul>, <ol>, and <li>. 
 These elements are typically used to structure the layout of a webpage and create distinct sections of content.

13. what is inline element?
An inline element is an HTML element that does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
 Inline elements are typically used to format small portions of text or other content within a block-level element.
 Examples of inline elements include <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, and <img>. 
 Unlike block elements, inline elements can be placed within block elements without disrupting the flow of the document.
